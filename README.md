### Tech Stack - Why Express, Postgres, and React?

I wanted to strike a balance between using tools that are professional, and tools that are the right size for the job. Also, I have a simple React-Express boilerplate that I made for Lighthouse students that I thought could save me some time :) Here's why I think each piece is a good fit:

#### Express

This API is really simple: It's just one endpoint, plus some auth routes. Express is very light on the boilerplate and has minimal indirection built in, and I thought that would make it easier to pick out what's important and interesting about the code.

#### React

If anything in this project is overkill, it's React.

#### Postgres

Postgres is just a no-brainer for me. It's the DBMS that I've worked with the most, and it's supported by default by Heroku.

### Location of deployed application
If applicable, please provide the url where we can find and interact with your running application.
### Time spent
How much time did you spend on the assignment? Normally, this is expressed in hours.
### Assumptions made

**1. The example URL indicates the desired pattern**

• `https://myapi.com/v1/weather` is the resource
• `city` is a query string parameter

**2. There are no other endpoints except for auth**

**3. Users want simplified data**

There is no reason to have this as an assumption other than it seems like cheating to just pass Open Weather Map's API data along without interacting with it in any way, so I decided that it would be fun to take the assumption that the users of Weather Peek want weather data in a simplified, conversationally-toned, conclusion-oriented format. It's kind of a goofy assumption, but I thought it would make the code more interesting.
